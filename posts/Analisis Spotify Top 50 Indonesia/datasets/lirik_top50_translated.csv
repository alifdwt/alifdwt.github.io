Terpisah jarak dan waktu
Ingin kuungkapkan rindu lewat kata indah
Tak cukup untuk dirimu

Sebab kau terlalu indah dari sekedar kata
Dunia berhenti sejenak menikmati indahmu

Dan apabila tak bersamamu
Kupastikan kujalani dunia tak seindah kemarin
Sederhana, tertawamu sudah cukup
Lengkapi sempurnanya hidup bersamamu

Jika hari kulalui tanpa hawamu
Percuma senyumku dengan dia, oh

Dan apabila tak bersamamu
Kupastikan kujalani dunia tak seindah kemarin
Sederhana, tertawamu sudah cukup
Lengkapi sempurnanya hidup bersamamu

Separate distance and time
I want to express longing through beautiful words
Not enough for you

Because you're too beautiful than just a word
The world stops for a moment to enjoy your beautiful

And if not with you
I make sure I live the world not as beautiful as yesterday
Simple, your laughing is enough
Complete the perfect life with you

If the day I passed without your husband
It's useless to smile with him, oh

And if not with you
I make sure I live the world not as beautiful as yesterday
Simple, your laughing is enough
Complete the perfect life with you

If not with you

Matahari tenggelam di dalam kemaron
Lembu betina lari melompat-lompat
Dikejar-kejar anaknya yang kecil meloncat

Senja lucu dengan kasih sayang ibu dan anak
Langit senja mengandung sapi beranak
Terpesona Ranto melihat, ia tertawa bergelak
Dan berubah jadi Ranto Gudel, sang pelawak

Dadi Marmoyo, di panggung ketoprak
Ranto Gudel, meminum arak
Terendam di dalam ciu

Diajaknya Nyai Dasima bercinta
Dengan cinta sepahit Topi Miringnya
Layar dibuka, turun hujan gembukan
Dewi Mlenuk gembuk datang

Membawa seguling roti cakwe
Marmoyo rebah terguling tidur
Di pangkuan Nyai Dasima
Yang sekeras ciu cangkol buah dadanya

Dusk in Baron Village
The sun sinks in Kemaron
Lembu Female Running Jumping
Chased by a small child jumping

Funny Dusk with Mother and Children's Love
The twilight sky contains beef beef
Fascinated by Ranto to see, he laughed
And turned into Ranto Gudel, the comedian

Dadi Marmoyo, on the Ketoprak Stage
Ranto Gudel, Drinking Arak
Submerged in ciu
The lust turns blue

He invited Nyai Dasima to make love
With love for the tilted hat
The screen is opened, it rains
Dewi Mlenuk Gembuk Comes

Bring a seguling of cakwe bread
Marmoyo collapsed sleeping
On the lap of Nyai Dasima
The one as hard as the breasts of his breasts

Where is Ranto Gudel goes
The stage is always fragrant with fragrant wine
In Sriwedari became Petruk
Gareng was invited to get drunk

Semar Selling Ciu Cangkol

It's good to be wedhus than humans
When dead buried in the mound of land
His head was tightened by the grazing wedhus
Human fate, only miserable,

Oh why do we have to bother?
Try to live like Ki Joko Lelur
In the afternoon daydreaming drinking lemonade
Night moved up, drinking drinking

Lapen Ciu Cangkol Arak Bekonang Poured
Shelled shell bottle in every corner of the house
What is the use of fear of rats apparently

Oh remembering the shadow of his old age
Ciu Cangkol is just a spiritus to get rid of mice
Even though I used to drink it until it was dead

Unconscious all this time
I also want you too?

Why is it difficult
For me can have your heart?
Even this time
My presence is worthless to you

What is happening now
I'm just your stopover when you were injured
And when everything subsides
You just disappeared

If there really is no hope
Why should I be the destination?
When your heart is injured, I became the cure
Without ever appreciating this sincere love and love

Why is it difficult

Why is it difficult
For me can have your heart?
Even this time
My presence is worthless to you, Ho-ho-ho

What is happening now

I wanna hold your hand and show what is love
When you are smiling and when you are laughing
We should keep dancing to treasure the feelings

Like it's the old love (it's the old love)
This is the way that we both wanna feel
Under the moonlight we made our first kiss
'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel
Like it's the old love (it's the old love)
Come on and hold me, I want you right here
Stay close to me so you don't feel the fear
I'll never let go 'cause I'm just right here

When I'm with you, it's like déjà vu
I realize that dreams really come true
We keep on talking for the moment we live in
Let's keep drinking 'till the moon disappear

You are the one, the one that I want
The one that will stay by my side till I'm gone
The love of my life and I'll sacrifice
Just for the moment we last long forever

Like it's the old love (it's the old love)
This is the way that we both wanna feel
Under the moonlight we made our first kiss
'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel
Like it's the old love
Come on and hold me, I want you right here
Stay close to me so you don't feel the fear
