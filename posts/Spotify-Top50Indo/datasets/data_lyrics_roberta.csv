 Seas would rise when I gave the word

 Sweep the streets I used to own

 I used to roll the dice 
 Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
 Listened as the crowd would sing 
 ""Now the old king is dead, long live the king"" 
 One minute I held the key 
 Next, the walls were closed on me 
 And I discovered that my castles stand 
 Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 
 I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
 Roman cavalry choirs are singing 
 Be my mirror, my sword and shield 
 My missionaries in a foreign field 
 For some reason, I can't explain

 Never an honest word

 It was a wicked and wild wind 
 Blew down the doors to let me in 
 Shattered windows and the sound of drums

 For my head on a silver plate 
 Just a puppet on a lonely string 
 Oh, who would ever want to be king?
